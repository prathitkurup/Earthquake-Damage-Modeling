# Earthquake-Damage-Modeling
Our project is to predict the level of damage to buildings that are hit by an earthquake using data from the Gorkha earthquake. Our research question is the following: What is the level of damage of buildings hit by an earthquake, and what characteristics might they share? Our data science research question can be motivated based on the research question as follows: Given characteristics about a building and its structural features, how can we build an ML model to identify the damage grade of a building after an earthquake?

We are using data from the Driven Data Richterâ€™s Prediction competition, which is compiled data from the 2015 Nepal Earthquake Open Data Portal. The dataset includes information on the buildings hit by the Gorkha earthquake in 2015. 

Our final model, an XGBoost classifier, performed the best out of all tested models. Please see the Colab notebook for code, testing, and discussion of results.
